  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>10â€“ 16 ounces ahi tuna, thawed (sushi-grade)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce or GF liquid aminos</li>
    <li>
      2 tablespoons high heat oil for searing- peanut oil, wok oil, avocado
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Pat dry the ahi tuna with paper towels.</li>
    <li>Place ahi tuna on a plate, coat all sides with soy sauce.</li>
    <li>
      Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, until very very hot. Turn
      your hood fan on. Place tongs, metal spatula and splatter guard (or lid)
      near the stove. When the pan is hot a flick of water should sizzle loudly.
      Once the skillet is hot, turn the fan on high. Add the oil and coat the
      pan and let it get hot. Carefully lay the tuna in the pan, pressing it
      down into the skillet with a metal spatula. Sear 45-60 seconds- checking
      the underneath by lifting one corner to see if it is golden. When deeply
      golden, carefully flip. If not golden, turn the heat up. Sear the other
      side, 60-90 seconds until golden. Sear the long edges using tongs to hold
      it upright.

      Place on a cutting board, blot if you like, then using a very sharp knife,
      thinly slice, and serve.
    </li>

      At this point, you could also refrigerate up to 3 days, and serve this
      later, chilled. Either way is good.
